To create the base meta.yaml I used grayskull:
https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/adding_pkgs.html#build

Commands for building(uploading to conda-forge - note this is just for testing):
# Make sure conda forge is allowed
conda config --add channels conda-forge
# Make sure we try to always get from the same repo if there are conflicts
# see https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html for more details on channels
# this avoids issues with conflicting c libraries and similar.
conda config --set channel_priority strict
# Actually build the recipe.
conda build hedtools

To locally install it after building:
conda install --use-local hedtools

Then you follow the instructions here to make a PR(this is the actual upload to conda forge):
https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/adding_pkgs.html#staging-test-locally

To install from conda-forge(in theory, doesn't work yet):
# Note the -c conda-forge shouldn't be required if you called the build config step above.(but users won't have done this)
conda install hedtools -c conda-forge
